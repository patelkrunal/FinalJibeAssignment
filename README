Play Application in response to Jibe Code Challenge
===================================================

Use the Instagram and Flickr APIs to return all photos with a #dctech hashtag within the last month and rank them by the amount of comments each received

Instagram API:
 - route "/jibeInstagram" will redirect user for authentication and finally we will land on "/auth" route.
 - This page will fetch data and created List of Image object and send it to view.
 - JibeInstagramView will simply shows gallery of images. 
 - I have sorted image objects according to comments. 
 
 Flicker API: 
 - Flow is pretty much similar to Instagram. 
 - I have used scribe library to implement oAuth flow. 
 - getting xml data. 
 - For simplicity using number of views instead of comments to sort data.
 - For comments, I need to call api for each image so I dropped idea because of time constraint.
